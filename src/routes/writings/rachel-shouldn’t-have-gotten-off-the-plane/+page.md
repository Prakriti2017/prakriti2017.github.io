Talk about unpopular opinion. Before you all start cancelling me, hear me out alright? Jeez.

So yeah everyone has watched F.R.I.E.N.D.S and when i say everyone I’m not including the irrelevant “oh so cool” folks who’ve missed out on something good. I mean I’m not judging them(totally), each to their own i guess( tasteless). Omg I’m cool alright, not one of those fandom obsessed ones( totally not). In this not so obsessed fandom (ahem), there are many Ross and Rachel shippers ofc, the “you’re my lobster” people. Wait i think i puked a little.kay. I’m obviously not one of those.

Oh so as i was saying(writing/typing…ugh) Rachel shouldn’t have gotten off the plane to go back to whiny Ross( no hate ya’ll, love and peace). Rachel, undoubtedly is the one character who undergoes a good development, from a rich spoiled daddy’s girl to a strong independent woman with bags( who runs the world? The capitalists and the rich #facts) sorry Beyonce. I mean, I’m a total Phoebe stan: she’s my spirit animal and i just love her but i do stan Queen Rachel too. As far as i remember, and as many times as i have repeated the show( you don’t watch it just once, you weirdo), I’ve always wished that she didn’t get off the plane. She could’ve gone to Paris, to follow her dreams, her career, her new life, away from the years of on and off again relationship, sis could’ve secured some more bags, maybe in time, could’ve fallen in love with a french hottie who would make her some delicious truffles. A whole new life… a new fantastic view of Eiffel tower.. no one to tell her “ we were on a break" omg Zayn just came into my mind just like that hehe. Alright so yeah, damn that phalange, damn you Phoebe( jk ily), and damn that seat mate of Rachel. If only that dude had not been such a wuss, that guy had the wussy soul of Ross let me tell you, it’s all a conspiracy, Rachel would have been sipping French coffee with the crepes. SMH.

So call it feminism, call it whatever you want i don’t really care( i do care okay, I’m just saying idc to look cool, if you say one bad thing I’ll remember that that for the rest of my life and cry to sleep). *cool noises* But the bottom line is, i would have loved to watch Rachel fly to Paris while Ross whined in his room. Okay this sounds so evil. Sorry Ross, you’re not that bad.

I just don’t like that they had to be together just because Ross happened to have a crush on Rachel, and she just HAD to reciprocate the feeling after finding that out and even if she did feel that way, the years of relationship they had, totally doesn’t fall under couple goals. Okay let’s not get so serious over a series( says this after writing a longass article about why a fictional character shouldn’t have gotten off the plane).

I tried to impart my wisdom( ik I’m a giver) in the nicest way possible *shy girl noises*, but if you decide to get butthurt over this fun little article, then my bad sweetie, “lobster” is totally real and so is santa.
