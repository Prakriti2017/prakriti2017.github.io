So this is a commercial movie( i say movie but it’s a series, just sounds better when I say movie), I don’t know about the artistic aspect of it but I promise it will be interesting. I however cannot promise that I will be consistent with my writings, chances are that the episodes will have huge gaps in between. I am not known for my consistency. Thank you.

Also, I am, for the lack of a better word, a lazy person but despite that, I did some research on “how to write a movie script”. This is a huge thing, clap for me. So, from my research, the only concept I grabbed was that scripts need a logline. A logline is a one to two-sentence description of a film that shows the most interesting elements of the storyline to hook the reader. Got it? Yes, I copied this from somewhere. Now the logline for my series, let’s hook you up.

“A delusional woman in her early twenties has the longest conversations with herself trying desperately to prove to herself that she is the main character”

Interesting enough? Hey i’m a rookie, go easyyyyy on me baby. HAve you heard this song? I love this song. Anyway, let’s get started. This is it for part one. I won’t talk to you guys like this on part two okay? part two is all about the movieeeee. Yay, netflix you know where to find me, if you don’t well spy on me.

Bye.
