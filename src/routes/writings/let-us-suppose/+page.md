We’ve done this a lot in maths haven’t we? oh by “this” i mean, let us suppose x = 0, yeah back then i used to lose my mind, like so we can go around just supposing anything? then why don’t we just suppose our final answer, while we are at it. Crazy stuff right?

Those people who asked “when am i gonna use this?” in their maths period, well i’m here to answer that question my child. “Let us suppose” is actually super cool, ngl.

Oh the point? Well we’ll get to the point later, first we have to dance around the point, admire it’s beauty yk? Anyway, yeah so people said ,let us suppose there was a big hot ball, it got so hot that it just gave up, it was like no man i can’t- and it exploded and then there was earth. No, i’m not teaching you astronomy okay? just.. just.. you know what i mean right? So yeah they supposed and though years ago, it didn’t make sense , it started to make sense later and people were like “ bruh spitting facts tho” and then here we have it in our science books. Like, what i mean is, it started with “let us suppose”

Also most of what we know was built upon supposition, if we don’t suppose that this is this and this is that, what can we do? We don’t know anything after all. So we keep supposing. Bro i sound so philosophical, TU professors shaking in their boots.

Oh now i get to the point, haa totally forgot what the point was, oh yes! So you have dreams like big big dreams? like really really big dreams and then someone comes along and tells you not to dream big cause yk you’ll cry to your mama if your dream fails or resort to weed or anything i mean yeah say no to drugs tho. So yeah people “care” about you and don’t want you to do that.

Oooo let me tell you about my dream, i want to be the richest person in the whole wide world, like rich in power, money, success, love everything. Yeah just that, i believe in simple living high thinking. IK. Just putting it out there. And i know i know people have been like- “haha”, acceptable response i’m hilarious.“yeah right!” but you’re wrong, “Yes you can!” and you can too!!, “So what’s the plan to achieve that”- bruh what? the plan? We have to have a plan? No thank you. Like i love dreaming about it , oh i’m well aware that i might be sounding lazy af right now. But it is what it is. Like i’m not gonna be sad for not being the richest person in the world, like i might be sad if i became the poorest, but we’ll see we’ll see. Anyway, what’s the plan? oh don’t worry i won’t do anything illegal, but i think i can learn how to shoot and box if taught by professionals, just putting this out there as well. Yk transparency and stuff. Totally not a request for mobs to hire me, nope. Oh yeah the point is that i love my dream and i love dreaming about living my dream some day, like i don’t wanna know the reality of life and what not, i’ll know when life shows me, don’t make me a sadass 23 year old bruh! Just let me live in my fantasy.

We sway away from the point and we get back to the point, that’s how we roll. OK. Let us suppose, you are like 10 and you really really love singing, or whatever you know you may have dreams that are not opposed by people like big dreams but not opposed, it’s cool too, but let us suppose, you want to be a model, or you know a power ranger, and then you’re a happy 10 year old thinking one day you’ll save the world and help people and then one sadass adult comes into your life like “ broooo What are you smoking bro?”, “we don’t do that here bro” ,”here we are sad because of our unfulfilled dreams”. And blah blah.

Anyway what i wanted to say is, whenever you see your friends, your ghar pachadiko uncle ko chorako sathi starting a rubber band selling page on facebook, like that page. It makes them happy. Like it may not be their passion or their dream to be the biggest rubberband seller in the world but it’s something. So yeah go do your thing, i’m not trying to be motivating, i just am, naturally yk, can’t help it. But yes, go become a singer in mexico and then even if you fail, you’ll get to eat tacos, or start that startup, even if it fails you can write “entrepreneur” in your linkedin bio. Flex bro. Go sell your panipuri man, but just make it a little bit spicy okk? Okk.

So let us suppose that you’ll get everything your heart desires, let us suppose you can do it, let us suppose you’re the best, let us suppose you are the smartest person ever. I suppose that everyday and oh yeah when i become the richest person, you’ll be glad that you read something of mine when i was struggling.
