I’m not saying that I will ever be painted on an actual canvas or anything but just because I’m not saying it doesn’t mean it won’t ever happen. Let’s imagine( because why can’t you), I could be from the future and this could be the most crucial information I could give you, fossils? plagues?, pff not so important, learning about my substantial contribution in the field of art, however, is pivotal(call me big words Prakriti). One might question, is there even a limit to my imagination? let’s imagine I’m the next Monalisa (I think you found your answer), or the first Prakriti, just putting it out there subtly- I’m modest like that. Anyway, to introduce you to the subject to be painted(me), I’m a female homo sapiens, I’m no painter, I cannot pretend to be an art critic or that I grasp the deep meaning of every stroke of a brush. If you show me a critically acclaimed painting, I could never be able to tell that the curly pubes in it are supposed to represent the ups and downs in a man’s life( Who even thinks that anyway) People are just weird(I’m so sorry for this slander). So, i guess it’s safe to say that I’m just a shallow onlooker, I see a painting and I’m like “okayyyy it has colors” and that’s that. Let’s just say, I’m no Picasso, well I think you knew that already but just in case you had a doubt- I’m not. Anyway, what I do know is that I have a great fondness for colors, they are special to me. I love the countless varying shades of red, green and blue splashed everywhere and anywhere. They are magnificent. Colors are magnificent because, well because they make things colorful(like- It’s literally right there in the name), they fill up the lifeless with life. Colors can show emotions, they can make you feel a certain way, a color can drastically change the meaning of art, just like that- simply magical, if you ask me. Okay alright, I do have my own intimate reasons other than that for my adoration of colors.

So kids I’m going to tell you a story about how I met my colors.

#### Pilot episode

It was the summer of well, years ago, I was little and i had these color pencils that i used to arrange ever so neatly, properly sharpened, in a line like they were students at my school. I would think of them as actual living beings and before going off to bed, I kept all my other pencils and colors in a purse, not leaving a single one behind. If somehow a pencil or a sharpener had to be kept out, I would put something else out there with it so that it wouldn’t feel lonely- I was a weirdo like that. I felt deeply for these colors, and I don’t know, I am not even an artist, I don’t remember drawing with those colored pencils but I remember playing with them. Each color had a different character in my mind, my own version of them, according to how I felt about these colors. Sure, I had dolls but I used to be so scared of them, seeing the still wide-eyed face of one at night petrified me, still does. So that is why I think I opted to play with my colored pencils and sharpeners and whatnot. These colored pencils truly made the best playmates. However, as seasons passed and I grew up, these memories began to fade away. Now as I write this to display my immense gratitude to them, for being with me and for being my friends, they are being repainted again in the brightest of shades.

#### Yellow💛

I do not like to be biased toward a color, and I do not endorse favoritism, the others could feel bad right? Even so, I do love love love love yellow (a prime example of hypocrisy right here). Yellow opens up to me within this unprejudiced adoration for all the shades of a rainbow, of the night sky, of the muddy roads. Now some could ask, huh? A color opens up to you? what are you? its therapist? My answer to them is simple, no it is in fact the color that is my therapist, it makes me happy. Think about the beautiful bright yellow painted sky at sunrise, think about the yellow hue of the sunflower, lemons, egg yolks, and yellow-colored lays? — I would not recommend it, it’s so bland, Yellow balloons, and even our emojis are yellow. Elite color. Period.

So, when I was little and loving my colored pencils like the cute little weirdo I was(am), I used to be kind of biased towards Yellow, I would make it the popular kid or the nice person everyone falls in love with, I had a soft spot for this color. It’s funny how I had forgotten all about this, I had forgotten all about yellow with time, until recently, these memories came back to me like lovely yellow rays of sun softly caressing me(sun-kissed yuh) and I’m so glad that I remember. Also, yellow looks good on me ( just facts). Sucks that last year I had many yellow dresses but it was being overused by people, it was like a literal mustard field in the streets of Kathmandu. I’m not pissed. I’m not pissed. I’m over it. I’m over it

Maybe, to the hooligans, yellow symbolizes cowardice, timidity, and so on but they don’t know what I know that they know… yellow speaks to me, I don’t feel like it’s a weakling, I feel as if the happy rays are shooting towards me( in a good way of course), I feel vibrant and anyway, we can ascribe whatever meaning to whatever word so if I were to give it a meaning, I would make yellow the color that symbolizes happiness and just pure bliss. Put that in a dictionary, right now, thanks.

So, this is for you yellow. Please always keep feeling yellow, as per my meaning. Next-

#### Pink💗

I would like to begin this with an apology to you. I’m so sorry my sweet sweet pink, I hated you in my rebellious teenage years but my innocent little heart at seven loved you, and so does my innocent heart at twenty-three ( God I’m an oldie).

When you see a pink sky, you don’t just walk along, you stop, stare for a while, take double-takes, let it capture your mind for a long time, snap a picture, and keep it as a memory. And that is simply powerful. Pink lures you, pink rules you, pink stays. Pink is sweet, pink is sassy, pink is powerful, pink is you. I think my dad loves the pink color on me, no I am quite certain about it, he buys me a lot of pink stuff and though I refused them years ago, I wholeheartedly accept them now. For me, pink is my dad’s love. It’s the pink little dress he bought for me when I was a child.

And when I played with colors, yellow and pink were two best friends, I remember that now. Isn’t it fun? you keep remembering and the memories just keep getting beautiful as I think about those days, makes me happy. Well, I am a happy person.

As I have grown to be a woman, I’m beginning to love pink and myself more. Also, pink too looks good on me so yeah. No, I’m not only writing about the colors I look great on okay? or am I? This is for you, Pink.

#### Red💓

Most adore red yeah? well it was my pretend favorite for a while. Omg i don’t mean that i don’t love it anymore, i do of course i do. Red is well, Red. Bold, Beautiful, Badass Red. I don’t know why i chose three ‘B’ words but they somehow came and worked, kind of like illegal foreign workers, but well good people. Red always reminds me of four things, rose, a bride, Manchester United’s jersey, red lipstick. Makes no sense i know but when i think of red these come to mind. Red is the queen color. Red headed women are pretty, red roses are pretty. Brides wear red dresses and they’re beautiful, queen color for the queen of the day and queen for every day after that. Very cool. Heart emojis are red, blood is red. They both are quite important for living if you ask me. The effect wouldn’t be the same if people wrote love letters in green colored blood, would it? or is it only strange because we’re used to red blood. We’ll have to study psychology and neuroscience for that. Hmm..

I’m great at going off topic, i know, thanks. You know what else is red? yes that’s right. Whatever you thought is right, if you were waiting for my answer, well sucks to be you. Red is a queen color which is why i’m displaying my badass queen behavior. Thank you.

So this is for you Red, You don’t even need much introduction, you’re always a Queen color.

I wanted to write something for every color, i really did but you know sometimes there aren’t enough words to describe everything special. I love all the colors okay, I’m sorry for not writing paragraphs about you, but i love you black, white, gray, green, blue, orange, mango, papaya, everyone okay? Don’t feel sad. Maybe there will be another amazing opportunity for you to star when i have better words that are worthy of you. Till then read about your friends who are as special as you are. Thank you all !

So if and when you paint me, let your brush touch every shade, let it feel them, let it listen to the colors. It may or may not be the most beautiful piece of art but it will be a piece of me with all my colors and all of me and i shall forever be thankful for that, thankful for not letting a single color escape the love of your canvas, thankful for making them stay. You know these colors are no longer just the pencils i kept so safe in my purse, now they draw me and i hope they will be kind enough, i hope you will be kind enough.

Note: I wrote it some years ago.
