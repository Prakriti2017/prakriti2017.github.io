I know I know, it’s been here for a long long time and yet nobody has talked about it, nobody but me, myself, and I. Well obviously I cannot be placed with everyone else, that would be so side character of me, ew. But worry no more, I'm here, your messiah to inform you about a wide-spreading, contagious syndrome, that's been giving quite the competition to our beloved recurring toxic ex like-corona. We won’t talk about corona though, that's so 2019, we’re all cool here.

I said we won’t talk about corona but I am an exception, I’m always an exception, why? you’ll find out later. Oh yeah, we love some suspense. Anyway, I’ve already gotten the Rona twice so I thought it deserved an honorable mention. I’m on a hattrick, after all, Ronaldo who? Okay back to the syndrome, some people living under the rock might ask, well what about it? what is this main character syndrome? So besties, in case you didn’t know, life is a movie. Yes I know it might be shocking to some of you, take your time to realize it, take deep breaths, calm down… calm down, take a shot of tequila, or chug on a bottle of milk, hey, watch your age! or whatever, you do you, it’s your movie. You know how in movies, there is the main character, and every plot, every little scene revolves around the main character? Yeah right now as I’m writing this, I am the main character and you’re the sides, the extras, sup random people! Everything I do, everywhere I go, I am the one I’m rooting for, I’m the one I’m watching all the time, I’m the one I’m following, I’m my own fan page posting my pictures and writing stuff, yk? It’s a mix of genres, there’s romance, there’s comedy, there’s tragedy, mystery, I for sure hope that there’s no crime. Do I walk around the streets randomly dancing with a guy, with 20 background dancers following my steps? No. Life is a movie, and it’s not bollywood.

We always want the best for the main character, don’t we? Like yes Tom Holland, become a spider! you go Nikhil Upreti, jump off the dharahara, Allu Arjun you do whatever it is that you do, Al Pacino, okay I can’t order you sir. So now you decide what you are, don’t worry you can be the main character of one of those Christmas hallmark movies, they're not good, but hey at least the main character is happy. Also don’t worry if you’re going to be one of those movies where the main character dies, lolol, cause you’ll be dead, why worry? See I’m in the dark comedy genre of my movie rn.

In conclusion, in conclusion? oh how professional of you prakriti, I’m proud of you, you’ve come a long way. So yeah, in conclusion, the main character syndrome is a syndrome very much necessary in our lives, and more people should get involved in this. If you’re sad, don’t worry it’s the main character sad era, happiness is right out there, someone doesn’t like you back, worry not, your real co-actor is somewhere out there giving auditions after auditions, knocking on producers doors(ooo this would be a great song for aspiring actors, knock knock knocking on…okay i’ll stop). Lost your job? lost someone close to you? time’s really difficult right now? it’s the sad era honey, what can we do but persevere and let time do its thingy. Do you get to the good part in movies just because you want it? no. You have to wait for it, wait for the crying part to happen, wait for 2 to 3 longass songs, for some unnecessary dialogues, some humbling character developments to happen. In the end, you are the main character, you rule, you own the stage, nobody is taking it from you. So sit back, relax, you were born a star.

Oh what if I'm the mainest(it’s a word because i said it is) of the main character? Hmmm? Wouldn’t that be cool? In my movie, you agree with me.
