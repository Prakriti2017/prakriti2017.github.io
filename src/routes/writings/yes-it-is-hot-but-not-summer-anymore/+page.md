<hr>

It is hot,

yeah very hot

And when I look up, the sky is blue

Evidence of summer

but where is my buwa?

where is his unmbrella shielding me from that heat?

it was summer then,

when me and my buwa were close

when i could lie on his lap as he told me stories

when he fanned my face with his self engineered fan,

when i could touch his face and tell him things

but it isn't summer anymore,

yes there is the heat,

yes buwa sits on the sofa right next to me,

but I can't lie my head on his lap anymore,

can't ask him to repeat his poems for hundred times anymore

I am not me anymore

buwa ad me are not close anymore

Yes there is heat, and yes it is hot but ther eis no summer anymore
