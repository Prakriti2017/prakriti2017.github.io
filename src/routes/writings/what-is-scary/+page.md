So what are you scared of ? please don’t tell me the dead child with a missing tooth? or spiders? or the nun? ew lame. Let me tell you what I- the parameter of everything great, am scared of, well the things that I get scared of change weekly, monthly , yearly, yeah basically timely. Right now I’m scared of internships. Of course internships have no fangs or scary face or spidery legs or anything like that. It’s funny if you think about it. Let me give you a perspective, aight coo.

There isn’t anything fundamentally scary about an internship, it’s just there, you know, like a pebble on the road, a murderer on the mall, like a tree somewhere in sometime, just a random thing, it’s just there like meh a mosquito(I’m sorry mosquito you might have value) and ofc tree gives us oxygen, okay okay back to the point. So if it’s just there why is it making me pee my pants? Why? Let’s think about it, I'm thinking as I'm writing, yes I work on real time haaa.

Anyway, I think it’s scary, Okay I've overused this word, thesaurus come help me please, okay frightening it’s frightening because I have to go get it. Like sugar from the grocery store, you know sugar just doesn’t walk to your home right? You have to get up go to the store and get sugar. No no online shopping. We’ve absolutely forgotten about the concept of that technology in this example. So yes buying sugar is frightening indeed, you have to get up, walk all the way, just imagine the probability of getting hit by a truck on the way to buy sugar, talk about a an extremely uncool death, ew. You could get kidnapped on the way to buy sugar, the shop owner could be a criminal in hiding and now you’re their next victim, they could sell you to the mafia ? Are you valuable? Yeah you think about it honey, you think about your self worth, but not right now, right now we’re scared. But hey, we did make it to the shop? okay let’s buy it, oh no! where’s the money ? you lost it somewhere, the embarrassing talk with the shopkeeper about how you lost the money is as close to death as one can get if you ask me. Okay so what is the point? Yeah the point is do you realize how ridiculous the example I gave right now is? You do? coo.(If you haven’t realized it yet, coo just means cool but yk i made it so yeah me coo)

Omg i’m going to sound motivational again, but it’s like breathing for me okay? So the point(thesaurus help) , so the tip , nope, so the point is that of course it is scary, the internship, you know? What if i don’t get it? What if i’m not good enough? What if i’m an idiot? It’s really humbling and makes you think the worst things possible i tell you, the other day i was thinking what if a mouse is better at job interviews than me? Yeah fear makes you do that, Me and mouse? I should at least compare myself with a cat? Pfff.

So yeah this is all for motivating myself, and to strive and to work. I do not want to say to work hard because what if working hard doesn’t bring me joy? So Iwill work and if i don’t get it(Omg nope i will get it okay?) We’ll see. There’s got to be multiple roads laid out for me and if one road leads to NewYork, maybe the other leads to Paris, Not too shabby not at all. I know I know there could be a road that’ll lead me to Jamaica(No hate, nope no hate to Jamaica you know I love you) but at the moment, I would really prefer the materialistic places? So if the road does lead to Jamaica there’s got to be a way to Paris from Jamaica of course there is! Otherwise there would be no people in Paris from Jamaica(Think!)

I simply cannot imagine being demotivated because of sugar, so I absolutely shouldn’t be demotivated because of Internships! What was I thinking?

Come at me Sugar!
